## üî∞ Introduction

<b>winj</b> is your go-to Java library for seamless Windows API access, leveraging the FFM API. With zero third-party
runtime dependencies, it offers an easy-to-use interface that simplifies native functionality integration, allowing
developers to harness the full power of Windows effortlessly.

## Details

- Gives the user more control over the memory (de)allocation through extensive use of arenas.
- Bindings are provided for both higher level API functions and types as well as lower level ones which are often
  completely missing in similar libraries.
- Function calls and types are constructed cleanly with fluent builders.
- Facades (`facade` module) are built around more complex and constant flows like hook management as well
  as logically tied components.
- Lightweight with zero third-party runtime dependencies (less than 1 MB in compiled size).

## Warning

No production promises: Names and locations might change, things might get refactored changing the fundamental structure. Published
full release versions will remain untouched (unless critical fixes are needed) and changes will only be shipped with the next version.
Snapshot versions might change at any time.
  
## Examples

Check out the [documentation] for various examples paired with explanations.
```java
// Re-usable
final WindowsAPI windowsAPI = WindowsAPI.of(arena);
final NativeContext nativeContext = NativeContext.of(arena, this.nativeCaller);

final Window window = windowsAPI.getForegroundWindow();
final String windowText = window.getText(nativeContext);
```
```java
final MemorySegment windowHandle = (MemorySegment) this.nativeCaller.call(
    CreateWindowExW.builder()
        .className(className)
        .windowName(windowName)
        .moduleHandle(moduleHandle)
        .style(
            Flag.combine(
                WindowStyle.WS_SYSMENU,
                WindowStyle.WS_CAPTION,
                WindowStyle.WS_BORDER
            )
        )
        .build()
);

this.nativeCaller.call(
    ShowWindow.builder()
        .handle(windowHandle)
        .presentation(WindowPresentation.SW_SHOW)
        .build()
);
```

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]    
> üë∑ winj is in early development and currently **not** feature complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requirements:
> - Java 22<p>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è *Java 22 (non-LTS) has been prioritized over Java 21 (LTS) because of the finalization of the FFM API.*
